# Global Condition scripts

Run the appropriate script to add the GCs described. These scripts require the Configuration Manager cmdlets
([see here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sccm/overview?view=sccm-ps#using-the-configuration-manager-cmdlets)).

## [BIOS version](BIOSVersion.ps1)

Return the device's BIOS version as a version number, so that the GC can accurately do comparisons.
